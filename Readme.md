My name is Marc Pagès Francesch and I'm studying a Game Development degree in the CITM from Terrassa. I've created this little game as a personal project to learn to use Unity. I really hope you enjoy playing it. If you want to check the code you will find it here: https://github.com/marcpages2020/Faster-than-Food

In Faster than Food you're a waiter and your main goal is to serve your clients as fast as possible. The faster you serve them the bigger the tip will be and try to remember well the order because you can only see it the first time!
The turn is four minutes long so in this time you will have to get the highest score possible.
