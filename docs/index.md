My name is [Marc Pagès Francesch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-pagès-francesch-7206b3186/) and I'm a Game Development student at CITM in Terrassa (Catalonia, Spain). I created this little game in order to practice Unity in my free time in summer.

# Instructions

You're the new waiter and your job is to bring the food to the clients as fast as possible. Every food and Drink has a base price which will be paid just for delivering it is what the client has ordered. If you bring it fast enough you will get a tip which decreases as time passes. To take the order get close to the table and the order will be shown on the left side. Every game is four minutes long and you can try to beat your High Score. 

There are two cooks on the upper side of the restaurant in which you can order the food. To do so get close to the cooks, don't be shy! Both cooks can cook at the same time. 
To get the drinks you must get close to the fridges next to the cooks' table. 
Next to the right fridge there's a trash bin. If you take a drink you didn't want to take or order the wrong food you can throw it there. 

You can either use the arrows or WASD to move.
